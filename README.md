##  Overview  
This project explores the **Spotify Churn dataset**, focusing on understanding user behavior and predicting churn. Churn refers to users who stop using a service within a specific period. By analyzing the dataset, we can identify key patterns and factors influencing churn, which is critical for customer retention strategies.
